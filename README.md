Just like what did I even see. Sikandar. Wow. My brain's still processing, like when you're trying to remember that one workout routine you did ages ago that left your legs feeling like jelly. The theater was buzzing, you know, like those flies that refuse to leave you alone on a hot summer day. Popcorn crumbs in my lap wanted to stay for the sequel, man, but speaking of sequels... I'd pay to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 Sikandar 2 while standing on a treadmill.

The hero, Sikandar himself, was just...like this mass of muscle and emotion combined, like if you mixed a dumbbell with Shakespeare, and somehow it just makes sense in that bizarre cinematic universe. Everyone around me was gasping, like when I suggest burpees to a new client.

> There's this part where he just stands there, you know, looking like he's lifting the weight of the world on his shoulders—reminded me of that one gym where the AC broke and we all became drenched philosophers. Not sure if it was intentional, but my back started aching halfway through, just as that fight scene kicked in. Coincidence? More like cursed   seats.

And the whole soundtrack... dude, it felt like a playlist someone on creatine might make. Drum beats like heartbeats after a killer set. And wasn't there a scene where… ah, spoilers. I won't be that person. But it reminded me—𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   legally or something. Just do it.

So cinematic, like... if Rocky got lost in a Bollywood carnival, and instead of finding his way out, he just danced his way into legend. But not like dancing-dancing, more like he was fighting gravity with every step, every punch like a powerlifter's battle cry.

I think you asked me to remind you or something—𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   when you can. You won’t regret it, swear. My ears are still ringing though. Or maybe I just forgot my earplugs. Gah, why do I keep doing that?

```csharp
// Maybe next time I'll remember what this was for:
int repCount = 10;
while (repCount > 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine(Lift, Sikandar, lift!);
    // More code probably goes here
}
```
